=====

SteVe was developed at the RWTH Aachen University and means Steckdosenverwaltung, namely power socket administration in German. The aim of SteVe is to support the deployment and popularity of electric mobility, so it is easy to install and to use. SteVe provides basic functions for the administration of charging points, user data, and RFID cards for user authentication. It supports Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) 1.5 and 1.2 and was tested successfully in operation.

SteVe is considered as an open platform to implement, test and evaluate novel ideas for electric mobility, like authentication protocols, reservation mechanisms for charge points, and business models for electric mobility. SteVe is provided under GPL and is free to use. If you are going to deploy SteVe we are happy to see the logo on a charge point.
